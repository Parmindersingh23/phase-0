     There is a lot I can write about Week 1, but I will keep it short since I am behind on work. Maybe I will come back and write more about it later.

     We learned about Git and Git Hub and how they work together and we can use Terminal to push and merge changes together.

     There are many benefits to using Github since a devolper can keep track of the many changes that are being made on files. They can also make their own branches and edit them and then re merge them to update the remote files. This way none of the master files get messed up.

     That is the main lesson I learned this week, I will try to come back and add more about it when I can.

  <!--

  What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

  The tags I learned about were the utf-8, section, main, aside tags. These will be used alot since they seem to be a important part of the html5.


  How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

  The elements and display elements will be laid out in top to bottom fashion. The browser will read the content first and the scrpits after if you have any.

  What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge?

  Sublime is an awesome tool, and you can customize it to your liking. I think you can really streamline your environment for you to code fast.

  Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

  Yes of course, why wouldn't you. Coders job is to make everything easier.
