#How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

  You can look at the elments and you can make all the changes live.

#How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

    You can modify the pixels, width, and height.

#What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning?

  Absolute - Using the positioning attributes top,left bottom and right to set the location. You can use this to place any element exactly where you want it.

  Fixed - Are independent of everything else on the web page. When page is scrolled the element stays fixed and always visible.

  Static - This the default positioning. When elements don't have a position set they will be defaulted to static. These will just automatically stack after each other.

  Relative - Positioning used that will be relative to its own position orginally. If given a top:30px, the postion will change 30px relative to the orginal position. Also with relative we can introduce the z-index.


#Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

  The easiest one would be static which is just the orginal position. The most difficult would be the relative positioning because you have to make sure ever other elments will work with the relative positions.


#What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?

  Padding - surrounds the content in a webpage.  Margin - surrounds the border and its the most outer portion of content.
  Border - edge surrounds the box's border.

#What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

  It wasn't too bad, it was just time consuming. Lots of research to learn new things. I liked it that we could see our changes live.
