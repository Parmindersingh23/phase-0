Describe what open source means.

  - Open source software is software that can be freely used, changed, and shared by anyone. Open source software is made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

 - I think it highly depends on what type of project you are working on. If you want to be able to work with others and get a lot of different types of uses of your code it can be great. It doesn't make me nervous or protective, thats where the different types of licenses can be used to protect your code in certain ways.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

 - It's important to use them to protect your self and to be able to share and collaborate freely with a certain set of expectations set by the license.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

  - Creating new files and editing them in sublime then uploading them is getting easier. I didn't have "aha" moments yet but when nothing went wrong that made me happy. I think when the commands dont work that's when you really have to search and learn about what is going on in the backround. Which is really benefical because you learn different ways of doing things that might be better or even easier.
