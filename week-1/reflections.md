#1.1 Think About Time

Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?

  Learned about Meditation and how to be in a mindful state. Learning how to focus on different types of things so you can react to your surroundings in a meaningful way. Try to take small steps to your goals. Be able to tackle those smaller goals to achieve bigger ones.Gain confidence by reaching goals by doing them a little bit everyday. Be about your goals don't just talk about them. Learn how to use time in a more productive manner, use time slots to train yourself to achieve more.

What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?

  Time Boxing is when you or your team selects a slot of time to get something done. It can be 25mins or 10mins. The goal of this is to get something done and for you to stop and look back how well you are utilizing your time.I will be using the Pomodoro method to set small goals and working on them in short bursts. Then I can reflect back and see where adjustments can be made and which topics I need to master.

How do you manage your time currently?

  Currently I just make a list of things that need to be done and get them done.

Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?

  I think it works ok, however there are no specifics set so time management wise it doesn't work too well.

Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?

  Yes, I will be employing the Pomodoro method and the meditation in the morning. I will most likely make my own custom time box solution that works for me.

What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?

  Have time slots throughout the day and complete the tasks in that manner. Not only for Phase 0 but for all the things that I need to get done daily. Use the modules and allocate appropriate times for each assignment.


#1.2 The Command Line
What is a shell?

  The shell is a program that takes your commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. Which uses the Command Line Interface.
What is "bash?"

  Bourne Again Shell is a command-line interpreter that provides users with a basic user interface. It allows users to communicate with the system through a series of commands that are typed in the command-line window. There are no buttons or pop-up windows in a shell, simply lots and lots of text.
What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

  Using the mv command can get confusing at times. Since you are moving around files by just looking at the file names and folder. Since we are so used to using a graphical interface it will take some time to adjust to using only text.
  I kinda of had trouble with the rm and rmdir. Some files just would not delete and I had to work around them to make it work.
  The Pipes and Redirection I need to practice on and get a better grasp on those commands, I did't fully understand what those were actually doing.
  The Find functions are simple enough, but combing functions can get confusing.

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

  Yes most of them, I still need to run through them again to practice the more complicated ones.
In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

  I think the most common ones will be cd,ls,mkdir,rm, and rmdir. These are the most basic ones and I think using these to navigate and create files will be very important. Also deleting and listing everything that you currently have will be important.
-pwd - Shows/Prints what directory you are in

-ls - This lists all the directors you have

-mv - You can use this function to mv files around

-cd - To change through directories

-../ - To move one directory up

-touch - Creates a file that is empty

-mkdir - Creates a new directory

-less - View and scroll through a text/file

-rmdir - Removes a directory

-rm - Removes a file

-help - will help you find all the commands available
