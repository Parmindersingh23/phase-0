What is your site's primary goal or purpose?

   My sites main goal is to show my ablities with webdevolpment and design. It is also there for to show case a little bit of my personality and all my contact information.

What kind of content will your site feature?

  Currently very minimal, such as contact info, personal informoation and projects that I am working on or have completed.
What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

  My Target audience would be people that would be looking to hire me for devolopment work. I will address the needs of my audience by showcasing all of the cool projects I have worked on.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

  Primary would be to contact me about job oppurtunites. Having a Social media page will help with that if they are interested.
What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

I think the main things would be ease of access to everything on the website and optimzing the space you have available which can work in smoothly. I think the main thing when a person goes comes to your website is the look and feel of the page. If everything looks and feels accessable to everyone then I think you would have succeded in making a good and functional site.
What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

Because we want users to perceive out website in the best way. “Does this website give me value? Is it easy to use? Is it pleasant to use?” Does our website potray this in the right way to your visitors?

It is important because we can test and fine tune many things to make sure everything works perfectly in tune.
