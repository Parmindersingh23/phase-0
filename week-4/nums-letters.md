#What does puts do?

Puts returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line.

#What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a whole number such as 2, 3 23, -23, etc and a float is number that has a decimal in it such as 2.3, -4.5, and 3.24.

#What is the difference between float and integer division?

Float division will contain the full result of the problem. (5/2 = 2.5)

Integer Division will give only the whole left over part. (5/2 = 2)



#How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

For example, with some things you cannot have a half something. If you want to buy sports ticket you can only buy those in whole numbers, you cant buy half of a ticket.So in those cases we can use intger division.

#How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Ruby handles these functions in the most basic fashion. Ruby uses the same functions that we have already learned from math classes.

#What is the difference between integers and floats?

Integers and whole numbers and floats contain decimals.

#What is the difference between integer and float division?

Integer will always output whole numbers and floats will give you remainders.

#What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings can be used for many things, they represent characters that are enclosed in single quotes. We can use them for setting variables.

#What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variables are used in the method it is defined in. Use them for methods that will be used often where you dont want to duplicate type a bunch of text.


#How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

Chanllenge wasn't too hard and it was a good refresher of the basics.
