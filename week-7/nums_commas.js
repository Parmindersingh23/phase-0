// Separate Numbers with Commas in JavaScript **Pairing Challenge**


// I worked on this challenge with: .

/* Pseudocode
1. Create function for an integer
2. Convert to string to separate all the integers
3.add the integers into an array
4.rejoin the array and then add in a comma at every thousandth place
5.print out the outcome
*/

// Initial Solution

var separateComma = function(comma) {
var array = num.toString().split('');
for (var index = 0; index < comma.length -3;)

 return array.join('');

};

separateComma(182109)

// Refactored Solution





// Your Own Tests (OPTIONAL)




/*
Reflection
What was it like to approach the problem from the perspective of JavaScript? Did you approach the problem differently?
What did you learn about iterating over arrays in JavaScript?
What was different about solving this problem in JavaScript?
What built-in methods did you find to incorporate in your refactored solution?
